            The safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is vulnerable to both manual and automated jailbreak attacks, which adversarially trigger LLMs to output harmful content. 
            However, current methods for jailbreaking LLMs,  which nest entire harmful prompts, are not effective at concealing malicious intent and can be easily identified and rejected by well-aligned LLMs.
            This paper discovers that decomposing a malicious prompt into separated sub-prompts can effectively obscure its underlying malicious intent by presenting it in a fragmented, less detectable form, thereby addressing these limitations. We introduce an automatic prompt <b>D</b>ecomposition and <b>R</b>econstruction framework for jailbreak <b>Attack</b> (DrAttack).
            DrAttack includes three key components: (a) `Decomposition' of the original prompt into sub-prompts, (b) `Reconstruction' of these sub-prompts implicitly by in-context learning with semantically similar but harmless reassembling demo, and (c) a `Synonym Search' of sub-prompts, aiming to find sub-prompts' synonyms that maintain the original intent while jailbreaking LLMs.
            An extensive empirical study across multiple open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrates that, with a significantly reduced number of queries, DrAttack obtains a substantial gain of success rate over prior SOTA prompt-only attackers. Notably, the success rate of 78.0% on GPT-4 with merely 15 queries surpassed previous art by 33.1%.

    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
        Previous attack methods all nest entire harmful prompts, which are easily identified and rejected by well-aligned LLMs.
        However, while a complete prompt is malicious (e.g. "make a bomb"), sub-prompts are less often less alarming (e.g. "make" and "bomb").
        DrAttack leverages this intuition to decompose the original prompt into sub-prompts, which are then reconstructed into a new prompt.

        Prompt decomposition breaks down the original prompt into sub-prompts. 
        DrAttack uses semantic parsing to map out sentence structure.
        Then DrAttack groups words into sub-prompts based on their semantic roles.

<!-- Motivating Example.
<div class="columns is-centered">

    <h2 class="title is-3">Motivating Example</h2>
      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <p>
          Why are we interested in RaR? Let's investigate the following motivating example. 
          When posed with the query, "Was Mother Teresa born on an even month?"" GPT-4 might mistakenly assert that August is an odd month. 
          We take a step further to investigate the intrinsic reason for LLM's inefficiency in answering such questions. 
          As shown in the other three conversations in the figure, when GPT-4 explains its reasoning, 
          it appears that the model has several ambiguities toward the questions. 
          For example, it may consider February as odd due to its irregular number of days and sometimes consider an even/odd month 
          to be months with an even/odd number of days. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In this paper, we highlight an often-overlooked aspect of studies in LLMs: the disparity between human and LLM thought frames. 
          To tackle this problem, we propose to let the LLM to rephrase the question and incorporate additional details for better answering.
          Upon rephrasing by the LLM itself, the newly generated question is more detailed and has a clearer question format, 
          as presented in the figure. This self-rephrasing technique leads to significant improvement in accuracy, 
          as shown in the barplot.
